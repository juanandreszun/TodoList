# TodoList
A To-do List on a Local Server using EJS
This project was created using a tutorial from the App Brewery. 
In order for it to work, you must create 3 more folders: Public, CSS, and Views.
Views should contain footer.ejs, header.ejs, and list.ejs.
Then you must create a Public Folder. Inside the public folder, create a CSS folder, then add the styles.css into the CSS folder.
In addition in gitbash or hyper, you must ensure you have express.js active in order to run the code.
